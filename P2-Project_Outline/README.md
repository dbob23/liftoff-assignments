## Submission Instructions

### Overview

        My idea is for an application that helps users find restaurants in their area that can
    accommodate food allergies and special dietary needs. I formulated this idea after speaking with multiple
    friends that have had a difficult time finding restaurants that can serve them meals that fit within their gluten-free
    or lactose-free diets.

        I would like my app to accept a user's input of zip code, a physical search radius in miles, and specific
    dietary restrictions such as "gluten-free", and search a database of restaurants for matches. These matches will
    then be displayed on a map and as list that includes links to websites.

        It will also be necessary to build a database of administrators by allowing restaurants to sign-up, log-in, and edit
    entries that include their relevant information.

### Features

    Search: Users will be able to search for restaurants in a given area based on
    selected special dietary interests.

    User login: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the apps in order to add and edit their
    name, location, and website link to the database.

    Display results: Results that match the user's search criteria will be displayed as a list of website URLs
    and as locations on a map.
